         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is but little poſſibility that the Scots will leave us this win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for they have charged horſes to goe to Newcaſtle for more armes, and planted themſelves by Troopes in ſeverall places of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: I will give you ſome particulars of their deportment.</p>
            <p>Five Souldiers quartered with a Widdow of <hi>Hutton</hi> a fortnight together, and though they had twelve pence a day allowed them for dyet, they paid her onely ſix ſhilling for them all, ſhe told them they muſt provide other quarters, for ſhe was not able to maintaine them at that rate, they anſwered they would; bought a ſix penny loafe, cauſed her give them milke to it, and went into the fields, brought home a fat ſheepe where with they ſupplyed
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:160068:3"/> their leane Commons: Thus are quarters paid, <hi>Eaſton</hi> men were forced to pay a penny <hi>per diem</hi> for every ſhilling that wanted of their Aſſeſſe; thus are monies collected.</p>
            <p>A Souldier at <hi>Hemlington</hi> broke his Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lords head, cut his ſervants lip, threw the meat about the table, broke the Pales, Kettles, and Piggons, becauſe his Landlord would not give him two ſhillings <hi>per</hi> day, and bid him complaine if he durſt; thus is the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try abuſed; the Officers have double pay for themſelves and unſeen ſouldiers.</p>
            <p>The Poſt boy of <hi>Durnton</hi> was robbed by the ſouldiers of <hi>Worſhall,</hi> and his horſe and purſe taken from him; no wonder though letters miſcarry.</p>
            <p>A Gisbrough man had two Horſes and three pound in money taken from his ſervant, by one <hi>Hamilton,</hi> as he was coming from <hi>Thrisk</hi> Market, the man and horſe was found out by the owner, and complaint made to the Captaine but no reſtitution; whereupon a Petition was preſented to the Lieutenant Generall upon Saturday was ſeven night at <hi>Gisbrough,</hi> who ſeemed to be very much of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, and commanded that the party ſhould
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:160068:3"/> be brought before him, but he was kept cloſe enough till the Lieutenant Generall removed, and that very day the Captaine and three more fell upon the owner (being Conſtable) and beat him very ſore, three ſwords being drawn upon him at once, and had ſlaine him at his owne doore, if very good helpe had not been preſently made, ſince which time the Conſtable is forced to abandon his owne houſe; this is ſharpe law.</p>
            <p>The Country at the ſame time when the Lieutenant Generall was at <hi>Grisbrough,</hi> was about to preſent a Petition wherein was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented their great ſufferings by the Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Army in particular expreſſions: and their humble ſuite for the removall of the two Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments before the Petitioners were totally conſumed; but the Lieutenant Generall was gone by three of the clock in the morning, whereby the Countries intentions was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, yet three men were ſent after him to <hi>Richmond</hi> with the Petition; but of their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe I cannot write becauſe the Meſſengers are not yet returned that I heare of.</p>
            <p>The Juſtices of Peace of our Wapentakes, and other ſubſtantiall Inhabitants have quite
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:160068:4"/> left the Country. It would mollifie an Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantine heart, to heare the bitter complaint<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> and rufull moanes that are ecchoed out in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very quarter; this is but cold comfort to hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry ſoules that have ſold their goods, borro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed monies, and morgaged their lands to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the ſouldiers: I wiſh the Commanders of that army would read the fifth Chapter of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah,</hi> and make him their pattern; or that they would make a generall (not a particular uſe) of the Covenant, they would then finde that delinquents are not brought to condigne puniſhment, but protected and quartered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, that the liberty of the ſubject is not maintained, but groſely abuſed. God in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſend them out of this Kingdome, that the Country be not totally conſumed, nor like to this poore Wapentake in a ready way to ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine and beggery, divers that have lived in an honeſt and ſubſtantiall way, wanting bread to put in their childrens mouthes when they cry out for hunger; Sir no more for the preſent, but that I am,</p>
